# Comparator
Comparator is a *web scraping tool* that scrapes the details of any product that a person desires to search for, or perhaps buy, and renders the results fetched. The details are then displayed in form of tables where one can easily compare the related **buy price**, **ratings** and even the **number of results** fetched.  
  
This tool could come in handy as you don't have to visit each of these 2 E-Commerce platforms, namely **Flipkart** and **Amazon**, for getting the details of a desired product. So yeah, it saves time. :)  
  
## Requirements
There's a file provided in the repository named `requirements.txt`. Run the following command after changing to the local folder holding the files.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This should download any necessary library required for running the tool.  
  
## Running the Tool
You do not have to interact with the tool everytime to provide the details for a desired product. Just follow the pattern given below to get you going.  
  
In the local directory which holds the files, run the following command.
```
python <file_name>.py <your desired product>

// eg.  python comparator.py oneplus nord
```
